                                The Last of Us is a third-person shooter where the player's means of offense are a range
                                of weapons; both projectile and melee; the lethality of weapons is very high, as in
                                reality. Players take control of Joel, with Ellie being an AI for most of the game,
                                however the player switches characters in the later parts of the game. Stealth is
                                crucial, crouching behind objects and navigating through environments quietly will help
                                get the drop on an enemy. A feature the developers call "dynamic stealth" allows for
                                many different types of strategies and techniques that the player can use at any given
                                time as they approach a new situation, to which enemies will react differently. The
                                developers particularly emphasized making Ellie, while an AI, an assistance to the
                                player rather than a burden to ensure the bond the story is creating between Joel and
                                Ellie is reinforced through the combat mechanics.
